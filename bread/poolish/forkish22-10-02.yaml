notes: I'd say it's biggest bonus is that it's really moist, and hopefully that doesn't backfire in storage. This is likely because I failed to knead it properly before bulk fermentation. I understand that now, I just mentally inserted an "until just combined". Even still the flavor is nice but I find this bread to be too white. I'm positive it can't dance, it will never look good in a bomber jacket, and it transfers to the 1-2-3 at Columbus Circle.
